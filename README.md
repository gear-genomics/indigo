[Indigo](http://gear.embl.de/indigo) is a rapid SNP & InDel discovery method in Chromatogram traces obtained from Sanger sequencing of PCR products. It can separate a mutated and wildtype allele and aligns both alleles against a reference sequence or wildtype chromatogram. Indigo discovers mutations generated by genome editing tools such as CRISPR/Cas9 or TALENs.
